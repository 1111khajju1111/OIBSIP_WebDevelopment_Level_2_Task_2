This project is a tribute page dedicated to Batman, the Dark Knight, developed as part of a web development internship. The page features a modern, glassmorphism-inspired user interface with smooth animations and a responsive design.

The project demonstrates the following skills:

HTML: Structuring the page content, including sections for "The Legend," "The Man Behind the Mask," and "Notable Allies and Adversaries."

CSS: Styling the page with a dark, thematic color scheme and implementing the glassmorphism effect for a sleek, frosted-glass appearance. CSS animations like fadeIn and liftFade are used for dynamic transitions.

JavaScript: A simple script manages the user experience, controlling the transition from an animated welcome screen to the main tribute page content.

The project is an example of a foundational task often given to web development interns to apply their knowledge and gain hands-on experience. It serves to showcase an understanding of fundamental web technologies and UI design principles.
